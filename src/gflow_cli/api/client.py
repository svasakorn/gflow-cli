"""FlowApiClient — typed wrapper around Flow's private REST surface.

Architecture: the client manages its own Playwright persistent-context

Google's session cookies attach automatically.

Usage:

        project = await client.create_project()
        asset = await client.upload_image(project.project_id, Path("hero.png"))
